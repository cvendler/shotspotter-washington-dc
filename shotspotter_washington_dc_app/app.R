Above, there are three tabs for you to explore: this tab, the Yearly Trends tab, and the Holidays 2014-2015 tab.  In the Yearly Trends tab, you will find an animation showing the locations and numbers of shots, either gunshots (single or multiple) or firecrackers, in Washington D.C. per month in the years 2012 to 2015.  You will also find a supplementary graphic.  In the Holidays 2014-2015 tab, you will have the opportunity to select which holiday (the Fourth of July in 2014 or New Year's in 2015) you want to explore.  The default selection is the Fourth of July, which provides you with an animation of July 4th, 2014 to July 5th, 2014, showing the locations and types of shots (single gunshot, multiple gunshots, or gunshot or firecracker) in Washington, D.C. per hour.  Select New Year's, and you will see an animation of December 31st, 2014 to January 1st, 2015, showing the locations and types of shots (again single gunshot, multiple gunshots, or gunshot or firecracker) in Washington, D.C. per hour."),
